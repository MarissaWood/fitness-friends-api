# Presentation Planning, (10 minutes)

## Introduction

- What's your app called? 

Fitness Friends, built by FML

- Who are your group members? Who had which responsibilities?

Francisco - user authentication, profiles
Marissa - activities component, CRUD and back end deployment
Leah - Styling, components, front-end deployment

- Why is it useful? What is your "pitch"?

Our app provides a platform to both find friends to work out with or to easily see when friends are working out and join them.  

## Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

User authorization/authentication allows for the creation of profiles and activity/event scheduling.

User profiles display the schedule and preferences of each user.

## Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part? 

    The most difficult part was 

- What did you learn? 

    We learned how to use git in a group

- What are you most proud of? 



## The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?

    This was our first idea.  After running through 

- How did you decide who would have which responsibilities?

    First, we 'pseudocoded' our steps to create our project and set goals for what we should accomplish by the end of each day.  At the beginning of the day we looked at the individual tasks and split them up as evenly as we could.  We also all tried to work on at least one thing we wanted to get better at.  

- What would you change about your planning process?

    After ging through this process, we realized that we didn't predict the time to complete some of the tasks very accurately, so we probably would have distributed the tasks a little differently.  



## The Workflow

- What Git Workflow did you follow? 

    We followed GitFlow because Zakk said so.

- What did you like about this workflow; what did you dislike?

    We liked that this workflow is the gold standard for collaborative group projects and that it also protects the code since we are still getting the hang of git. 

- Did you run into any challenges with this workflow? How did you solve them?

    The problems we ran into were mostly about using git in a collaborative way since we haven't really done that before.  

## The Week

- What was your week like?

    The week felt a bit rushed since we had less time to work compared to project 2.  

- Did you feel the Emotional Cycle of Change?

    We felt it on a less severe scale than project 1 or 2.  When you have a group, you can reassure each other and pick up the slack and balance each other out.  

- How did you work together?

    We worked really well together, communicated very well.
