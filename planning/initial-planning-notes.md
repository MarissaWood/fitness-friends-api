# Project Idea and Initial Planning Notes

*Commit early; commit often*

By the end of Day 1 of Project Week, you need to submit:
Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
A list of your models and their properties
These and any other planning assets (wireframes, user stories, etc) should go inside a planning/ directory inside one of your project repositories. Planning and Process is one category by which we will be evaluating your project.

Fitness Friends is a tool for fitness enthusiasts to find and work out with a partner who is equally excited about a class or fitness category. Users can create an account, create activities that they would like to participate in, and invite friends! 

## Models (and properties):

- **User**: username, email, password, profile picture
- **Profile**: username, profile picture, preferences/interest, friendlist, schedule 
- **Activity**: name, location, time, description (example: running with a friend)
